the VOP2 is a rockchip specific processor it seems to support a decent set of SoCs though.

rk3288
rk3368
rk3366
rk3328
rk3036
rk3588
rk3066
px30
maybe more..

This driver targets rk3588 however it can be easily made to work with the SoCs above...
Not that others are worth porting WoA to but someone could be insane enough to try.
